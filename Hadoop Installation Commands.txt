Single node/Multiple node Hadoop Installation  

Procedure:   
ALGORITHM 
STEPS INVOLVED IN INSTALLING HADOOP IN STANDALONE MODE:- 
1. Command for installing ssh is “sudo apt-get install ssh”. 
2. Command for key generation is ssh-keygen –t rsa –P “ ”. 
3. Store the key into rsa.pub by using the command cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> 
$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys 
4. Extract the java by using the command tar xvfz jdk-8u60-linux-i586.tar.gz. 
5. Extract the eclipse by using the command tar xvfz eclipse-jee-mars-R-linux-gtk.tar.gz 
6. Extract the hadoop by using the command tar xvfz hadoop-2.9.0.tar.gz 
7. Move the java to /usr/lib/jvm/ and eclipse to /opt/ paths. Configure the java path in the 
eclipse.ini file 
8. Export java path and hadoop path in ./bashrc 
9. Check the installation successful or not by checking the java version and hadoop version 
10. Check the hadoop instance in standalone mode working correctly or not by using an 
implicit hadoop jar file named as word count. 
11. If the word count is displayed correctly in part-r-00000 file it means that standalone mode 
is installed successfully. 


ALGORITHM 
STEPS INVOLVED IN INSTALLING HADOOP IN PSEUDO DISTRIBUTED MODE:- 
1. In order install pseudo distributed mode we need to configure the hadoop 
configuration files resides in the directory /home/lendi/hadoop-2.7.1/etc/hadoop. 
2. First configure the hadoop-env.sh file by changing the java path. 
3. Configure the core-site.xml which contains a property tag, it contains name and value.
 Name as fs.defaultFS and value as hdfs://localhost:9000 
4. Configure hdfs-site.xml. 
5. Configure yarn-site.xml. 
Page 
6. Configure mapred-site.xml before configure the copy mapred-site.xml.template to 
mapred-site.xml. 
7. Now format the name node by using command hdfs namenode –format. 
8. Type the command start-dfs.sh,start-yarn.sh means that starts the daemons like 
NameNode,DataNode,SecondaryNameNode ,ResourceManager,NodeManager. 
9. Run JPS which views all daemons. Create a directory in the hadoop by using 
command hdfs dfs –mkdr /csedir and enter some data into lendi.txt using command 
nano lendi.txt and copy from local directory to hadoop using command hdfs dfs – 
copyFromLocal lendi.txt /csedir/and run sample jar file wordcount to check whether 
pseudo distributed mode is working or not. 
10. Display the contents of file by using command hdfs dfs –cat /newdir/part-r-00000


MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTED MODE INSTALLATION: 
ALGORITHM 
1. Stop all single node clusters 
$stop-all.sh 
2. Decide one as NameNode (Master) and remaining as DataNodes(Slaves). 
3. Copy public key to all three hosts to get a password less SSH access 
$ssh-copy-id –I $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub lendi@l5sys24 
4. Configure all Configuration files, to name Master and Slave Nodes. 
$cd $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop 
$nano core-site.xml 
$ nano hdfs-site.xml 
5. Add hostnames to file slaves and save it. 
$ nano slaves 
6. Configure $ nano yarn-site.xml 
7. Do in Master Node 
$ hdfs namenode –format 
$ start-dfs.sh 
$start-yarn.sh 
8. Format NameNode 
9. Daemons Starting in Master and Slave Nodes 
10. END
